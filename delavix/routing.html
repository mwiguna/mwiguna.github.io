						Routing is define what url which you want to use. <br>
						You will found the routes file in 
						<span class="codeCol">/app/routes.php</span>

						<br><br>How to configure it? <br>
						<pre><code class="language-php">$route->url("/", "home", "index");</code></pre>
						if you have opened route.php you will see the code like above.<br>
						That's define of your route, if you access the route "/", the machine will working on "home" Controller in method "index".<br><br>

						If you want to make other routes, you may add route like the code below : <br>
						<pre><code class="language-php">
$route->url("/", "home", "index"); //your route

//login page, will worked by homeController -> loginPage Method
$route->url("/login", "home", "loginPage");

//admin page, will worked by homeController -> adminPage Method
$route->url("/admin", "home", "adminPage"); 
						</code></pre>

						So, the term of routes can  interpreted like this :
						<pre><code class="language-php">
$route->url("/", "home", "index");
// "/"         => url
// "home" => Controller
// "index" => method 
						</code></pre>
						If you don't put the method in the code, the machine will auto describe that route using index method : 
						<pre><code class="language-php">$route->url("/", "home"); // will working on homeController -> index Method</code></pre>
